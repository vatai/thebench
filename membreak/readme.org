* MemBread - Breaking the program with memory allocation

Reason/backstory: I had an MPI program breaking when given larger
parameters.  Based on some quick calculations, the parameters were
still very far from what actually will be needed for a real life
application, but the auxiliary data-structures might have eaten up the
memory.

Description: I want to see when and how does a program break, if I
"want too much memory": will it break at allocation, will it break
when reading the memory will it break when writing the memory.
